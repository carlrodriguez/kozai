# Carl's Kozai Code

For integrating the secular equations of motions for the three-body problem, 
including the quadrupole and octupole terms (see Tremaine+2009, Petrovich2015 and Liu+2015)

Also includes relativistic terms for the inner binary, including:  
	1pN Pericenter precession (ala Ford+2000)  
	Gravitational Wave emission (ala Blaes+2002)  
	Spin-Orbit coupling (ala Rodriguez and Antonini 2018, identical Barker and O'Connell 1975)  
	Spin-Spin coupling (same)  
  
You are welcome to use either code in any way you like, though we ask that if you
use any results from it in a paper that you cite Rodriguez and Antonini (2018, 
https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08212) and Antonini et al (2017, https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07142) 

The code can be compiled with:
	g++ -o kozai kozai.C -lgsl -lgslcblas -O3
Then run ./kozai --help for a list of options.

The default triple, when integrated with all the physics, i.e. 
	./kozai --quad --oct --peri --rad 
should recreate the left-hand panel of Figure 2 from Rodriguez and Antonini 2018

Finally, top-level information about the system is printed to stdout,
while the actual integration is printed to stderr
