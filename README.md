# Kozai Codes with orbit-averaged Spin Terms

Two codes for integrating the secular equations of motions for the three-body problem, including the quadrupole and octupole terms (see Tremaine+2009, Petrovich2015 and Liu+2015)

Also includes relativistic terms for the inner binary, including:  
----1pN Pericenter precession (ala Ford+2000)  
----Gravitational Wave emission (ala Blaes+2002)  
----Spin-Orbit coupling (ala me, following Barker and O'Connell 1975)  
----Spin-Spin coupling (same)  
  
You are welcome to use either code in any way you like, though we ask that if you use any results from it in a paper that you cite Rodriguez and Antonini (2018) and Antonini et al (2017, https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07142)
